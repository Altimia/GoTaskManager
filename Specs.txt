Go Developer Project: "GoTask Manager"

Overview:
A command-line based task manager where users can add, view, update, delete tasks, and communicate with other users in real-time.

Features:

Basic Task Operations

Add, view, update, and delete tasks.
Each task has a name, description, status (e.g., "Pending", "In Progress", "Completed"), and an assigned user.
User Management

Register, login, and manage user profiles.
Real-time Communication

Chat with other users in real-time.
Get real-time notifications when a task assigned to you is modified.
Technical Specification:

Basic Syntax & Data Types

Use of Go's syntax, variables, data types like bool, int, byte, float32, etc.
Functions & Multiple/named Returns

Modularize code with functions.
Use multiple and named returns where appropriate.
Conditionals

Implement if and switch statements for decision making.
Going Deeper

Data Structures: Use structs to model a task, user, and chat message. Implement arrays, slices, and maps where required.
Concurrency: Use goroutines and channels for real-time communication.
Error Handling: Implement error handling, panic, and recover scenarios.
Packages & Go Modules

Structure the project with multiple packages and manage dependencies using Go modules.
Building Command-line Interfaces (CLIs)

Use Cobra or urfave/cli for CLI creation.
Marshalling & Unmarshalling

Parse input and display data using JSON marshalling and unmarshalling.
Web Framework & Communication

Use Gin or Echo for building RESTful APIs for user and task management.
Implement real-time communication with Melody or Centrifugo.
ORM & Database

Use GORM to manage database operations with tasks and users.
Ensure type casting and type inference are applied appropriately.
Logging

Integrate Zap or Logrus for logging operations, errors, and information.
API Clients

Create API clients using Heimdall or GRequests.
Testing

Write unit tests and integration tests for various components of the project.
